# hackr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hackr is to wrap the Hacker News API in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tylurp/hackr")
```

## Example

You can fetch top stories, new stories, or best stories. By default, a `tibble` is returned, if there is a _kids_ column (comments identifier), it will be nested in order to return a single row for each story. You can override this with `unnest = FALSE`:

```{r example}
library(hackr)

hackr_top_stories()
hackr_new_stories(2)
hackr_best_stories(2)
```

That's it for now. Will add more features soon.
